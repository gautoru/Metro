Metro Route Tracker


This project aims to display a best route from a start station to a end station which the user wishes to travel.
This also prints the total fare for the travel and also indicates whether the user has to change from one lane to the other lane during the travel.
(In real world metro application there are currently green and purple lanes which we have considered and implemented our project using these lanes)

Steps to Execute the program:

1. When the program is run,safety measures will be displayed.
2. User will have to enter the name and gender.
3. Then the user has to enter the start and end station number ranging from 1-9 .
    (We have selected a specific graph which connects green and purple lane, the image of that graph is also attached in the zip folder for reference)
4. The route that the user will have to take will be printed along with the lane to which each station belongs.The total fare for the travel will also be displayed
5. Then if you wish to book another ticket then the user has to enter 1 or else enter 0.
6. After all the required number of tickets are booked, the user enters 0 and wishes to end the ticket booking process.
7. The ticket sales report will be printed.
